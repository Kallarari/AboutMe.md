# ABOUT ME
------
## Programer and designer for over 3 years, I wass iniciated learning programtion for games sice I was adolescent.   The design comes with this, due to the fact that it's no use to be able to give life to things, without things first.      I started in 2017 the college that I wanted sice I was a child, electronic Engineering, in this course I learned several programming languages, such as C, C++, Python and Assembly, along with the programming paradigms.
